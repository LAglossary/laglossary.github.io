    "overview": "Usually defined as the ability to do something successfully. In our context, this can refer to successfully dealing with digital artifacts. Indicators of success can of course be quizzes and tests (that is the easiest case). In cases when users take such tests at several points in time, we can study growth of competence. <br/>Other indicators of competence could be the derived from the complexity (=>) of the materials a user interacts with (maybe in relation to the time spent with these artifacts; just opening a website and closing it right away is probably not an indicator of success). Within a learning trajectory on a given learning scope, competence trajectory could be assessed this way. "
