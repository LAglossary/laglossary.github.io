    "title": "Productive Friction and Echo Chambers",
    "overview": "One central element of all models of knowledge construction and of the co-evolution model is the idea that ‘productive friction’ drives learning processes: Only if we encounter something new or unexpected and if we integrate this information into our existing cognitive structures, we can learn something new. Expected and beliefs confirming information only leads to a deepened belief in what we believed to be true, anyway. However, when given the choice, human beings ‘always’ prefer information that is consistent with their beliefs (this phenomenon is known as  ‘confirmation bias’, JSFT01). Hence, confirmation bias can (and presumably does quite often) stand in the way of learning. This may for example lead to the very unwanted echo chamber effect (DBZPSCSQ16): When given the choice, individuals prefer to form internet communities with like-minded people. Given that access to information is more or less unlimited, these communities can then only select and perceive consistent information; this may over time lead to more and more isolated, disengaged, and radical communities (and not to learn because of a lack of productive friction)."
