    "title": "The Co-Evolution Model of Learning and Knowledge Construction",
    "overview": "In this tradition, the co-evolution model of learning and knowledge construction (Cress & Kimmerle, 2008) treats learning on the side of individuals and knowledge construction on the side of communities as two structurally coupled processes: Irritations of a learner’s cognitive system in form of new or unexpected information that has to be integrated into existing cognitive structures leads to learning processes in form of changes in the learner’s cognitive schemas, behavioral scripts, and other cognitive structures. In turn, such learning processes may trigger communication acts by learners within knowledge construction communities and stimulate further communication processes that lead to the construction of new knowledge. In this model, shared artifacts, for example in form of digital texts such as contributions to wikis or social media messages, mediate between the two coupled systems of individual minds and communicating communities (Kimmerle, Moskaliuk, Oeberst, & Cress, 2015)."
