    "overview": "A learning trajectory comprises “… the learning goal, the learning activities, and the thinking and learning in which the students might engage” (Martin Simon, 1995, p. 133) = what happens inside and outside the head: Sum of all interactions and the processes that are triggered by these interactions. <br/> What was call a learning trajectory is (the totality of all learning scope related activities), should maybe better be called a learning path, at least as no latent user characteristics (experiences, competency gains …) are taken into account."
