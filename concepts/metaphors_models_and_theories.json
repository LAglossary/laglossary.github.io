    "overview": "A theory is a system of ideas and statements (such as e.g. definitions, operationalizations, assumptions about causal influences, …) that allow for conjectures of the kind ‘A => B’ (prediction; explication) and apply to a potentially unlimited set of concrete empirical cases (generativity). <br/> A Metaphor or a Model (in this sense) is an oversimplification of reality as means of making some features or characteristics of a complex system understandable => metaphors and models are ‘always wrong’, because they are deliberate oversimplifications. <br/> Hence, when we talk about metaphors of learning, we are aware that these metaphors are oversimplifications that serve the function to make a certain notion evident - no metaphor or model in itself is right or wrong; but they can be helpful or appropriate in certain context with regard to certain aspects of a complex ‘truth’ (whatever that is)."
