    "title": "Motives and Motivation",
    "overview": "Motivation is what drives people to do something. Sometimes, we differentiate in psychology between ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors in motivation. Push motivations arise from the desire to satisfy needs such as autonomy, attachment, relatedness, success … The most basic and abstract level of these needs (comparable to the level of personality with regard to interindividual differences) are the “big three” needs of affiliation, achievement, and power/autonomy. There have been empirical studies that showed that interindividual differences regarding these basic needs can be predicted from behavior traces such as short informal communication (postings etc.). The LIWC software has word scales referring to these basic needs. <br/> Pull motivation arises from the wish to achieve goals. More often than not, pull motivation is stronger than push motivation. If we have clear statements of goals, we now quite a lot about a learner’s motivation. If not, we can try to extract information on goals from behavioral traces (like the intensity/frequency of engagement with difficult artifacts). (=> learning scope)"
