    "overview": "All activities – intentional or not and conscious or not – that can lead to encounters that can trigger learning processes. <br/> In other words, a LearningActivity is an Activity which contributes to at least one of the learner's Learning Scopes. Obviously, this definition is very much dependent on the definition of other concepts. A Learning Scope is in particular a key notion. The idea here is similar to the one of `Educational Alignment' but for learners rather than resources: It represents the purpose of a learning trajectory, which might take the form of a learning objective, a learning goal, or simply a (set of) topic(s)."
